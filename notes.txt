Spring branch experiment, it might be easier to manage configuration and the valkey client object using spring and spring beans.
I want to test the difference in perfomance and resource usage.

work on command line args, probably use external library.

--caching: enable caching, create and use valkeyclien (Mandatory for now)
--sync: enable syncing state with valkeyclient
--file: hand files, maybe seperate ones for commands.yml and redisson.yaml
