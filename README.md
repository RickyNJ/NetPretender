*Network device mocking
This is the application that will be running inside a docker container you can ssh into

The following features will be (hopefully) implemented:

    [ ] Yaml file parsing to store mocks in code

    [ ] Custom response file to keep longer responses out of the yaml

    [ ] Variables in commands

    [ ] Variables in output

    [ ] Output customization (delays, and outputting in multiple parts)

    [ ] Internal State of a machine

    [ ] Referencing to internal state in output

    [ ] Conditional outputs based on varialbes and internal state
